Hello World!

I am starting a journey to learn computer science and how to code. My first step is graduate school, where I can learn skills in a burgeoning field like data science or machine learning. I will then start working as a computer scientist, hopefully making a decent salary. I have hobbies like cars, snowboarding, and triathlon, that I need money to fund. Maybe after that I will join a start up or start my own company.

I am still a novice programmer, but I'm certain I can grow my skills.
